# SvelteKit-Template Documentation

Welcome to the SvelteKit-Template Documentation!

This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the architecture of the project and information that will help you during development, as well as autogenerate API documentation.

## Preparing the Environment

If you have already setup the project by following the README, you can skip this section.

Otherwise, install the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)

> **NOTE:** Ensure your restart your computer and Docker Desktop is running after installation.

Then, either follow the [setup script](./getting-started/setup-script) or manually setup the environment by following the [setup guide](./getting-started/dev-env-setup).

> **Even if you already setup the environment, I would recommend reading about the setup script since it is a useful tool for debugging and fixing issues.**

## Next Steps

After setting up your environment, I recommend reading the rest of the Getting Started sections. After this, read through the Core Concepts to get an understanding of the project's architecture.

## TODO

> In the future, these will be handled with GitHub issues or Trello tasks.

- Add testing (unit and web)
- Add logger
- add auth rate limiting
- implement front end error handling
